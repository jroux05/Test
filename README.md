# Test
Just testing some code.
<!DOCTYPE html>

What I'm testing:
<ul>
  <li>Inserting Links</li>
  <li>Text Elements</li>
  <li>Tables</li>
</ul>
  <h1>Links</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Link to GitHub</a>
  <p>
    I'm learning to code uning html, and this is where I test all of the code I learn. I'm learning from the website <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" tare=get="_blank">Codecademy.com</a>, which teaches its users how to write code in html, javascript, and many more.
  <br />
  <h1>Text Elements</h1>
  <p>These are three text elements commonly used:
    <ul>
      <li><b>bold</b></li>
      <li><i>italics</i></li>
      <li><sub>subscript</sub></li>
     </ul>
   </p>
  <p>
    <b>Bold text is made with the html element b. This will make any text after this element bold, until the closing tag, /b, is used.</b>
      </p>
     <ul>
       <b>THINGS TO NOTE:</b>
       <li>When making text bold or adding any other element, you need to put greater than and less than signs around the opening and closing tag.</li>
       <li>This page was created simply for me to test out html code that I've learned. This is in no way supposed to be a learning place for people learning html.</li>
       <li>All of the code that I have learned has been from Codecademy.com, a great learning site for people learning how to use any type of code, not just html.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <i>Italic text is made using the tag i. This will make any text italic until the closing tag, /i, is used.</i>
  </p>
